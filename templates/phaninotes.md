Project-1 -- Books
In this project, our team built a book review website. Users will be able to register for our website 
and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books,
leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people.

This project consists of
1.reg.html - In this, a user is able to register if user is new one or login if user is existing
2.login.html - In this , user will be dispalyed a search bar to search books
3.Book_Page.html - In this, user will be displayed searched book along with book details
and also there will be an option to review this book and previous comments will be dispalyed

In this project, my role is to do search feature
Firstly, I implemented a search bar to search the books.
If users want to search for books, they can be able to search based on ISBN,title or author of the book.
For user convenience, I implemented not only complete search but also partial search.
In this partial search feature, users will be able to search books based on some part of title, ISBN or author of the book.
After searching is done, the matched search results of books will be displayed in a table.
In that table, user will be able to select a specific book to see using View Book Link
After clicking view book link, it will be redirected to bookpage. 
In the bookpage, the selected specific book details will be dispalyed to users.
Below those details, a user will be able to review the book and also previous reviews given by other users to that book will be displayed.
