Task-1: To set up a PostgreSQL database which can be hosted.

I firstly navigated to heroku website(www.heroku.com).
I created a account as I have no account in it.
I also created new application named sapprojectone2019501026
I had added Heroku Postgres addon which is required to this project.

Task-2: To setup FLASK environment and try to run a sample Flask application.

I installed flask using pip command i.e., pip install flask
I downloaded the zip file i.e., project1 in which there are some files required to test flask.
Then I installed requirements.txt which contains all necessary Python packages for this project.
I had set the FLASK_APP to the filename to test the flask i.e., application.py
I had set FLASK_DEBUG to 1 which activates Flask’s debugger and this is used to reload your web application whenever you save a change to a file automatically.
I had set DATABASE_URL to the one which i got in Heroku credentials.
I had run application using flask run.
The output must be "Project 1: TODO" !
But I didnt get this. Then I asked my PC about this.
He told that updated version of "Werkzeug" is not working. SO I uninstalled it and downloaded same on e but with version 0.16.0 which is working.
Then I used command flask run and I got a url which resulted to show the required output "Project 1: TODO" !
Time taken for this total task : 45 minutes
