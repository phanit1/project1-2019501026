Task 1 : Create a Basic Registration HTML Page with CSS and Bootstrap
I first researched about the tags which are used to create a registration form
Then I got to know about form, label, input, button tags
form tag is to create a form
label tag is to create a type and box to type that type.
input tag is to give input based on type
button tag is to make a button
Then I created a basic registration form with some styles like adding different colours to register button,input boxes etc.
Time elasped for this task : 30 minutes

Task 2: Making HTML Page connect to server
 I learned about flask and how to connect a html page to web server.
 I got to know that I should use render template for connecting HTML files and store html files in templates folder and style css files in static folder as they will be static.
 I also got to know how to change the linking format of css files in html as we are using flask
 I referred tutorialspoint and NGLMS video to know about render template.
 Time elasped for this task : 30 minutes

 Task 3: Displaying the data submitted through Register Button using GET, POST methods
 Firstly, I took more time to complete this task as I donot know more about GET,POST methods
 It took more time to understand those methods and to link to this project
 Then I learned GET and POST methods and took refernce of tutorialspoint to send the data 
 i.e., only email address submitted to display on a page
Time elasped for this task : 1 hour
