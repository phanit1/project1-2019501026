Task 1 : Create a Basic Registration HTML Page with CSS and Bootstrap
I first researched about the tags which are used to create a registration form
Then I got to know about form, label, input, button tags
form tag is to create a form
label tag is to create a type and box to type that type.
input tag is to give input based on type
button tag is to make a button
Then I created a basic registration form with some styles like adding different colours to register button,input boxes etc.
